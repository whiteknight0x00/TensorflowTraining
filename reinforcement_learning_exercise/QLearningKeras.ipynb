    "Congratulations on completing this lab!  In this lab, you explored various strategies to enhance the performance of the Q-Learning agent, such as experimenting with different network architectures, implementing adaptive exploration rates, and customizing the reward function. These variations help reinforce your understanding of the Q-Learning algorithm's flexibility and the impact of different hyperparameters and strategies on the learning process.  \n"
